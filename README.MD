# netscan

This is an API adaption to the Original RustScan, which extends it's functionality for use as a native Python module e.g. Extension Module.

As of this commit, the Wheels distribution is built via RustScan version: 2.1.0 Release.

# How to Use.

Using the module is simple. Simply install the latest version via pip.

```bash
pip install netscan-td4b
```

The default Batch Size is set to 10. The batch size is essentially the number of concurrent ports to check at a time e.g. check 10 ports at a time.

The default timeout (time to wait for a TCP timeout) is 1.5 seconds (1500 miliseconds).

Note that these are extremley conservative defaults and hence lead to low performance. To increase the performance for you're environment tweak these by setting the environment variables.

Here is an example of how to use the NetScan extension module:

```python
>>> import os, netscan
>>> # Sets the concurrent number of ports to check at a time to 1500!
>>> os.environ["SCAN_BATCH_SIZE"] = "1500"
>>> # Sets the TCP Timeout to 0.5 seconds
>>> os.environ["SCAN_TIMEOUT"] = "500"
>>> netscan.run_scan(["10.0.0.1","10.0.0.28"])
>>> ['10.0.0.1:53', '10.0.0.1:80', '10.0.0.28:135', '10.0.0.28:139', '10.0.0.28:445', '10.0.0.1:443', '10.0.0.28:3389', '10.0.0.28:7680', '10.0.0.1:8080', '10.0.0.1:8181', '10.0.0.1:21515', '10.0.0.28:27036', '10.0.0.1:49152', '10.0.0.1:49153', '10.0.0.1:49154', '10.0.0.28:49670', '10.0.0.28:57621']
>>> exit()
```

Additionally you can scan for only a specific set of ports or service(s) via an optional secondary argument, like so.

```python
>>> import os, netscan
>>> # Sets the concurrent number of ports to check at a time to 1500!
>>> os.environ["SCAN_BATCH_SIZE"] = "1500"
>>> # Sets the TCP Timeout to 0.5 seconds
>>> os.environ["SCAN_TIMEOUT"] = "500"
>>> netscan.run_scan(["10.0.0.1"],[80,443])
>>> ['10.0.0.1:80', '10.0.0.1:443']
>>> exit()
```

Cheers!
